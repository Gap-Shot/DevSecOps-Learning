# DevSecOps-Learning
This project is for myself to learn about CI/CD. It currently is configured to
check out code, build docker image, and pushes the docker image to AWS ECR.
The AWS component uses ECR for containers and fargate for networking. 
The code itself is just a simple calculator deployed using NGINX Alpine. While 
this project is not focused oon web development, I want to expand on it more by
adding backend code in S3 or a similar AWS service to help expand my knowledge 
on the cloud end.
